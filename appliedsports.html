        <h2>Primary focus of the system</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To create a specialist of the player by making him feel more natural in his position, offensive or defensive.</li>
            <li>To enhance defensive and offensive hand skills.</li>
            <li>To learn the "what if" factor.</li>
            <li>Controlling your opponent.</li>
            <li>Learn counter-for-counter containment skills.</li>
            <li>Learn close-quarter contact sparring skills.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The System</h2>
        <p>The primary focus of the system is to make each player, offense or defense, a specialist in his position by developing skills that offer natural ease.
        These skills include: offensive hand techniques, counter-for-counter, "what if" factor and controlling the opponent.</p>

        <h2>The Concept</h2>
        <p>In today's ever changing game of football, coaches and players are searching for the "winning edge."
            One area that is a prime target is the combination of power, srength and physical training with hand/eye/total body coordination, flexibility, and balance
            through the martial arts. </p>
        <p>Applied Sports Martial Arts has translated a lifetime of martial arts training and football wisdom into a user-friendly, practical form.
            The core training involves three minute rounds of physical contact drills with a one minute rest.
            Skills learned in these rounds can be applied immediately by a pro athelete with absolutely no prior martial arts experience.</p>

        <h2>The Benefits</h2>
        <p>Through a process of drilling and muscle repetition, players develop the ability to anticipate movements by other players, react faster and counter the hits made by their opponents.
            The player becomes both physically and mentally aware of the space around him, giving him an uncanny sixth sense and a true edge in the competitive arena.
            Applied Sports Martial Arts is a hands-on scientific process.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Applied Sports Martial Arts is a rarity; an advanced program developed solely for football, with life-long applications due to the use of more mind/body potential than has ever been attempted.
            The attributes that go well beyond mastery of the physical aspects of the game apply the mental attitudes that are learned in martial arts and football. A marginal player becomes a vastly improved player.
            These techniques are used daily by some of the most prominent professional teams and players in football today.</p>

        <h2>The Training Overview:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Field Awareness</li>
            <li>Position and the Opponent</li>
            <li>Field Tactics</li>
            <li>Action Patterns</li>
            <li>Contact - Focus</li>
            <li>Source of Force</li>
            <li>Physical Conditioning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each area is studied and taught under strict supervision.
            Both defensive and offensive players will see direct benefits of understanding the power and theory of the martial arts and the use of them associated with football.
            Also, special private lessons and assembly presentations can be provided in practical defensive martial arts.</p>
